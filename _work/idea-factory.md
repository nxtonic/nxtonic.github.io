Forgive me for getting "meta" for a moment, but I came up with this idea to generate entrepreneurially viable ideas.

I also wanted to see how performant I could make a web application _without_ using any external libraries or frameworks. The result is pretty good, with it loading from __github.io__ in a time of `~250ms` if you have a good connection. I'm pretty happy with that.

This was also good practice at dealing with the HTML5 history api and a few other little javascript tidbits that I'd never messed about with before. It's still in progress, but has been good fun so far.

At some point this project might be scaled up to include the submission of new ideas and possibly even automatically generated ideas based on machine-learning.
