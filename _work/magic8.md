I never had a __magic 8 ball__ as a kid, so I decided to make myself one. You can use it too if you'd like, it's pretty (in)accurate.

Development only started on this in April 2016, so it's pretty stock-standard so far. I'm planning to practice my SVG drawing and animation skills as well as employing javascript best practices to create a framework-less application.
