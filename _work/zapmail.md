While working for [Naavi](http://naavi.co), I was tasked with turning a photoshop drawing into a one-page site for __Zapmail__. The product is a simple version of the likes of mailchimp _(et al)_ for sending out emails en masse, while maintaining options for personalisation. It had to be responsive and quick to load while maintaining the interactive components across all devices.

To achieve this, I used __modernizr.js__ to check for touchscreen devices and CSS media queries apply various styles conditionally. In order to save page weight whilst maintaining image quality, I decided to use SVGs for the product icon and divider images.

_See the finished site below_
