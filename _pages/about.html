          My name is Angus, I grew up in Melbourne, Australia where I continue to live whilst studying at university. I've been interested in computers from a young age yet only began learning web development in the final year of high school. From there I began to teach myself more advanced concepts while moving on to study IT networking, ultimately leading to my current pursuit in the field of cybersecurity.

          In my spare time I like to switch between software development, graphic design and motorcycling. Simplicity and minimalism are important concepts to me, and I try to apply them to as much of my life as possible. In a world where bigger is regularly perceived as better I try to maintain the smallest footprint I can.

          I hope one day to be part of a team that uses technology to genuinely make a positive difference to wider society, whether that be through automating mundane activities, protecting from harm or enabling those at a disadvantage to achieve a more level playing field.
