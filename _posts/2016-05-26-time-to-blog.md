I've decided that it is time to start blogging. It should be a good way to pace my development progress and also to consolidate my learning about various programming languages, frameworks and tools.

I'll be mostly writing about software development, particularly to do with __microservices__ and creating __testable__, __modular__, and __easily deployable__ applications. This is all stuff I know virtually nothing about right now, so I'll be learning as I go and might make mistakes. I'll probably also throw in some 'life and times' stuff too, just for a bit of variety.

So without much further ado, let us begin! :rocket:
